Differences between modern and old C++:

In variables definition and constants:
	Modern C++ versions changed the way to declare and initialize C++ variables:
	Example of modern C++: 
		Declare and initialize an age variable to 0: int age {};
		Declare and initialize an age variable to a value: int age {25};

	Example of old C++:
		Declare and initialize an age variable to 0: int age = 0;
		Declare and initialize an age variable to a value: int age = 25;


In Statements and Operators:
	Modern C++ versions changed the way to do conversions from one type of variable to another:
	Example of modern C++:
		static_cast<type>
		Cast an integer value to a double: average = static_cast<double>(total) / count;

	Example of old C++:
		Cast an integer value to a double: average = (double) total / count;
		
	Difference:
		Modern C++ cast it's a little bit more restrictive than the old C++. The old cast just assumes the value can be converted, but the static_cast double check if the value can be converted to the new type.
